          <p>
            During our summer job Future Youth Camp, we made this game with our group La Mona. The main content, in this camp, are IT and programming in HTML, Bootstrap and java script.
            We only had three weeks to do a game and a page and this is the result of those weeks. We did not know each other before this project but during these three weeks we have come to known our group in a better way. The only thing that we had in common was that we are all born in year 2000.
            Future youth camp has been a good thing for us,it has changed our view on education and work. We hope you enjoy the game!
